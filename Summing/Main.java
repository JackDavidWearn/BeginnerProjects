/*
 *
 * A sum-based project is a great way to get started with Java programming. 
 * The project is quite simple â€” the user will input two numbers (which are treated as the variables A and B), 
 * and the program will add them together and present the sum of A + B. 
 * This can help you learn to work with methods and integers. 
 * JavaTPoint offers a great guide for a Sum A + B project, and working through this type of project can help you become familiar with Java processes.
