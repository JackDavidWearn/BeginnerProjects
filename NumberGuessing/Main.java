 * 
 * This is a simple game that can help you get your feet wet with Java. The game is relatively simple â€” the computer generates a random number, 
 * and the user must guess the number. The computer will then let the user know that their guess is too high, too low, or correct. 
 * This can be free-form, allowing an unlimited number of guesses, or give the user a set number of guesses before the game ends.
